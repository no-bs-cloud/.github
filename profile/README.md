## Welcome to noBS! 👋

noBS! is a French software consulting company, focusing on execution and delivery.

We’re a small team of seasoned professionals with a simple task: get the job done !

While modern applications and developers often come with inappropriate use of latest bleeding-edge technology, often leading to excessive abuse of computing resource and sky-rocketing costs, we focus on efficiency and reliability instead, because each project is different and there’s no one-size-fits-all silver bullet.

We are vendor neutral, with no particular technological or commercial affiliation. Our goal is not bill you 100+ consultancy days but to provide you with the hard, honest truth and do whatever it takes to make things right. No bullshit inside !

We are the company behind [Kowabunga](https://github.com/kowabunga-cloud). We believe in self-hosted, self-maintained, highly profitable platform blueprint. We believe in people, in in-sourced skills, because SaaS companies success only come when you master your own destiny.
